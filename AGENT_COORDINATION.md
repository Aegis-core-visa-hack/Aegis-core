## 2. KEY DECISIONS (With Rationale)

### Tech Stack

| Component | Decision | Why | Alternatives Considered |
|-----------|----------|-----|------------------------|
| LLM | **Gemini Pro/Flash** | Cost-effective, good structured output | GPT-4, Claude |
| Database | **PostgreSQL + pgvector** | Unified relational + vector, ACID | ChromaDB + SQLite (rejected: two systems) |
| Agents | **PydanticAI + LangChain** | Type-safe, RAG support | LangGraph (rejected: overkill) |
| Backend | **FastAPI** | Async, Python ecosystem | Flask, Django |
| Frontend | **Next.js + shadcn/ui** | Modern, component library | React + custom |

### Architecture

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Agent count | 5 specialized agents | Separation of concerns, but manageable |
| Shared memory | Vector DB + Event Bus | Context coherence across agents |
| Detection | 3-layer hybrid (Regex → Semantic → LLM) | Cost/speed optimization |

### UI/UX (IMPORTANT FOR UI AGENT)

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Dashboard type | **Static, pre-built components** | Simpler, reliable, covers 80% of needs |
| GenUI | **SKIPPED for MVP** | Too complex, not needed for core demo |
| Chat | **Text-based responses** | Not dynamic UI generation |
| Screens | 4 main screens | Dashboard, Entity Table, Alert Detail, Chat |

---

## 3. PIVOTS & MISTAKES (Learn From These)

### ❌ Things We Tried and Abandoned

#### Pivot 1: Generic vs Visa-Specific
```
BEFORE: Designed for "any financial institution"
- Included GitHub code scanning
- Included Slack message monitoring
- Included Jira ticket creation

AFTER: Redesigned for Visa's actual needs
- Removed code repo monitoring (not Visa's scope)
- Removed internal chat monitoring
- Replaced Jira with GRC workflow systems

WHY PIVOT: Visa is a payment NETWORK, not a bank or software company.
They don't audit member banks' source code.
```

#### Pivot 2: GenUI
```
BEFORE: Planned GenUI - AI generates dynamic UI components

AFTER: Dropped GenUI for MVP

WHY PIVOT:
1. 10x more complex to implement
2. Static dashboards cover 80% of use cases
3. Text-based chat is sufficient
4. Risky for demo (AI-generated UI can break)
```

#### Pivot 3: Multiple Databases
```
BEFORE: ChromaDB for vectors + SQLite for relational data

AFTER: PostgreSQL + pgvector (single database)

WHY PIVOT: One database = simpler ops, unified transactions, better for compliance auditing
```

#### Pivot 4: LangGraph
```
BEFORE: Considered LangGraph for agent orchestration

AFTER: PydanticAI + LangChain

WHY PIVOT: LangGraph is overkill for 5 agents. PydanticAI gives type safety.
```

### ✅ Things That Worked Well
- User persona analysis before UI design
- Problem statement deep-dive before architecture
- Hybrid detection approach (cost/speed tradeoffs)

---

## 4. VISA-SPECIFIC CONTEXT (DON'T LOSE THIS)

### Who is Visa?
- **Payment NETWORK** (not a bank, not a software company)
- Creator of PCI-DSS (they wrote the rules)
- Works with 15,000+ member banks, millions of merchants
- Operates in 200+ countries

### What Visa Monitors (NOT what we initially thought)
| DOES Monitor | DOES NOT Monitor |
|--------------|------------------|
| Transaction patterns | Member bank code repos |
| Member bank compliance status | Internal Slack/Teams |
| Merchant PCI certifications | Developer environments |
| Cross-border data flows | CRM systems |
| Regulatory changes globally | |

### Problem Statement Alignment
> "Create an agentic AI-powered compliance platform built on autonomous, agent-based systems that can make decisions, plan tasks, and operate independently using tools and data, without constant human supervision."

Key requirements from PS4:
1. Autonomous agents (not just assistants)
2. Tool use (agents call APIs, databases)
3. Multi-step reasoning
4. Adapt based on feedback
5. Natural language interaction
6. Audit-ready evidence generation

---

## 5. USER PERSONAS (For UI Design)

### Sarah - Compliance Officer (Primary User)
- Daily monitoring
- Needs: Alerts, investigation details, quick actions
- Pain: Information overload

### James - CCO (Executive User)
- Weekly oversight
- Needs: High-level score, trends, board-ready summaries
- Pain: Can't get straight answers

### David - Relationship Manager
- Manages member bank portfolio
- Needs: Entity status, action items
- Pain: Manual tracking

### Maria - External Auditor
- Periodic audits
- Needs: Evidence, documentation, exports
- Pain: Chasing documents

## 8. API CONTRACT (Backend ↔ Frontend)

### Endpoints UI Agent Should Expect

```
GET  /api/dashboard/summary     → Compliance score, counts, agent status
GET  /api/alerts                → List of alerts (filterable)
GET  /api/alerts/{id}           → Alert detail
GET  /api/entities              → Member banks/merchants (filterable)
GET  /api/entities/{id}         → Entity detail
POST /api/chat                  → Send query, get text response
GET  /api/regulations           → Regulation list
GET  /api/risk-heatmap          → Risk by regulation
```

### Response Shapes (Examples)

```json
// GET /api/dashboard/summary
{
  "compliance_score": 78,
  "score_change": 3,
  "open_violations": 23,
  "critical_alerts": 3,
  "agents": [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Regulatory Intel", "status": "online", "last_run": "2026-01-05T08:00:00Z"}
  ]
}

// POST /api/chat
{
  "query": "Which banks have expiring certifications?"
}
// Response:
{
  "response": "3 banks have certifications expiring within 30 days:\n\n1. **First National** (BNK-1234)...",
  "data": [...],  // Optional structured data
  "actions": ["send_reminders", "view_details"]  // Suggested actions
}
```

## Session Log
Date: 2026-01-05 04:31
Agent: UI Agent
Conversation ID: 7050b5a7-28d9-4a66-a2c3-711fa1a44aec

### Context Documents Used
- [x] ARCHITECTURE.md - Section 7 (User Interface)
- [x] UI_CONTEXT.md - Helpful: screen mockups, tech stack, mock data spec
- [x] AGENT_COORDINATION.md - Referenced: pivots, MVP scope, API contract

### What Was Helpful
- UI_CONTEXT.md had excellent screen mockups and component specs
- Mock data examples were directly usable
- Dark theme color palette was well-defined

### What Was Missing
- Nothing significant - docs were comprehensive

### Decisions Made This Session
- Used shadcn/ui v4 (compatible with Next.js 16 + Tailwind 4)
- Extracted AlertActions to client component (server component can't have onClick)
- Kept chat as text-based (as per GenUI pivot decision)

### Work Completed
- [x] Dashboard page (`/`) - Metrics, Risk Heatmap, Alerts, Agent Status
- [x] Alerts list (`/alerts`) - Severity badges, status, navigation
- [x] Alert detail (`/alerts/[id]`) - Evidence, recommendations, action buttons
- [x] Chat interface (`/chat`) - Message history, suggested queries, mock responses
- [x] Entities table (`/entities`) - PCI status, risk levels, filters
- [x] Header component with navigation
- [x] All shadcn components installed
- [x] Mock data file (`lib/mockData.ts`)

### Handoff Notes for Next Agent
- **Dev server**: Run `npm run dev` in `/frontend`
- **API Integration**: Replace mock data imports with fetch calls to backend
- **Real-time**: Consider WebSocket for alerts (currently static)
- **Filters**: Entity table has filter UI but no logic yet

## Session Log
Date: 2026-01-05 04:33 - 05:00
Agent: Backend Implementation
Conversation ID: 7a2b658f-ef69-43b6-b7e2-ab03f07596d5

### Context Documents Used
- [x] ARCHITECTURE.md - Agent specs, shared memory design
- [x] AGENT_COORDINATION.md - MVP scope, API contract
- [x] reference_repo/logic_specs/*.txt - Database schema, API specs, Agent 3 logic

### What Was Helpful
- Logic specs gave complete API response shapes
- Mock data from frontend ensured compatibility
- Decision to skip auth for hackathon saved time

### Work Completed
- [x] FastAPI backend structure (main.py, routes/, agents/)
- [x] All 4 API route modules (dashboard, alerts, entities, chat)
- [x] Agent 3 Transaction Monitor with PAN detection + Luhn validation
- [x] Demo endpoints for live scanning (/api/demo/scan)
- [x] Gemini integration in chat (with mock fallback)
- [x] Frontend chat page updated to call backend
- [x] Verified end-to-end: chat shows real API responses

### Files Created
- `backend/main.py` - FastAPI app with CORS
- `backend/models.py` - Pydantic models  
- `backend/mock_data.py` - In-memory data
- `backend/routes/dashboard.py` - 4 endpoints
- `backend/routes/alerts.py` - 3 endpoints
- `backend/routes/entities.py` - 2 endpoints
- `backend/routes/chat.py` - Gemini chat
- `backend/routes/demo.py` - Agent 3 demo

## Session Log
Date: 2026-01-05 05:00
Agent: Frontend-Backend Integration
Conversation ID: 49a7654d-04ea-4602-98f9-ad9791812747

### Context Documents Used
- [x] AGENT_COORDINATION.md - Referenced: MVP scope, session logs
- [x] Backend routes (dashboard.py, alerts.py, entities.py)
- [x] Frontend API client (lib/api.ts)

### What Was Helpful
- API client was already implemented with proper type definitions
- Mock data structures matched backend responses well

### Work Completed
- [x] Dashboard page (`app/page.tsx`) - converted to client component with API fetching
- [x] Alerts list page (`app/alerts/page.tsx`) - added filtering, API integration
- [x] Alert detail page (`app/alerts/[id]/page.tsx`) - converted to client component
- [x] Entities page (`app/entities/page.tsx`) - added search, filtering, API integration
- [x] All pages have graceful fallback to mock data if API unavailable
- [x] Loading spinners added for better UX
- [x] "Demo Mode" indicator when using mock data

### Verification
- Backend server running on http://localhost:8000
- Frontend running on http://localhost:3000
- Browser testing confirmed:
  - Dashboard loads with live API data (78% compliance, 47 violations, 5/5 agents)
  - Alerts page shows 5 alerts from API
  - Entities page shows 6 entities with filtering working
  - No "Demo Mode" indicator = API integration successful

### Handoff Notes
- **MVP Status**: ~95% complete (up from 85%)
- **Servers**: Backend on :8000, Frontend on :3000
- **Remaining P1 items**: 2D Heatmap (Criticality × Due Date)
- **Demo ready**: All pages functional with real API data
